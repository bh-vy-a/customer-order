# Run The Project: Visual Studio
This project is just another ASP.NET project so every official docs or tutorial related to ASP.NET will also apply to this project.
Basically there are at least five simple steps:
- Open the project using Visual Studio
- Change the connection string (appsettings.json) to target your MS SQL Server
- Right Click Clean
- Right Click Build
- Run the project by clicking green play button on your Visual Studio toolbar
note: The project will automatically create the Database if the database not already exists.
